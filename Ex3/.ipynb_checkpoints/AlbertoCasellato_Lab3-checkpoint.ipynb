    "A quality control engineer works at a factory that produces washing machines. The number of defective washing machines manufactured each day follows a Poisson distribution with an unknown rate parameter µ. \n",
    "The objective of the engineer is to estimate µ based on observed data and prior knowledge. \n",
    "Over the next 5 days, he observes the following number of defective products: x = (3, 0, 1, 5, 2)."
